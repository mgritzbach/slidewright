# Slidewright

**Editable decks, engineered rather than approximated.**

Slidewright is a Codex plugin and deterministic layout compiler that turns ideas and structured content into native, editable PowerPoint decks without the usual formatting damage. It treats slide generation like a build pipeline: compile constraints, render native objects, lint the result, inspect the exported OOXML, and retain evidence.

The Build Week entry targets **Work & Productivity**. The initial vertical slice proves the hardest, most reusable behaviors:

- equal outer margins and symmetric internal padding;
- automatic text fitting that selects conventional integer point sizes;
- native editable text and shapes;
- mixed bold and regular text runs;
- overflow, clipping, and formatting lint rules;
- machine-readable QA evidence for every build.

## Quick start

Requirements: Node.js 20+, Python 3.11+, and a Codex environment with the bundled `@oai/artifact-tool` presentation runtime.

```powershell
npm run setup:runtime
npm run preflight
npm test
npm run demo:compile
npm run demo:lint
```

To execute the full artifact-level demo, run:

```powershell
npm run demo
```

`npm run setup:runtime` discovers the installed Codex presentation runtime rather than relying on a version-specific local path.

Outputs are written to `outputs/demo/` and include the editable PPTX, rendered previews, compiled layout plan, and QA reports.

To prove that ordinary edits do not collapse the layout, run the whole-word copy mutation benchmark:

```powershell
npm run mutation
```

It rebuilds -25% and +25% copy variants, then lints, renders, audits, overflow-tests, bundles, and verifies both decks.

## Controlled export-fidelity benchmark

The competition benchmark renders six owned design specifications—invitation, brochure, and website, each in horizontal and vertical/mobile composition—through both a browser reference path and a native PowerPoint path:

```powershell
npm run fidelity
```

That single command preflights the required runtime, captures exact browser references, exports the PPTX, creates native PowerPoint groups, checks every named object's text, font, integer size, color, position, rotation, and insets, renders all slides, builds difference images, runs a real PowerPoint ungroup/regroup round trip when PowerPoint is installed, and verifies the final delivery package before reporting success.

This is a controlled exporter-conformance proof, not yet an independent image-ingestion test. The current run passes all 129 object checks with zero raster fallbacks and no overflow. It achieves 0.97528 global, 0.91844 foreground, and 0.72427 background-normalized average similarity; the latter prevents a blank background-colored slide from passing. See the [benchmark protocol](docs/BENCHMARK.md), [limitations](docs/LIMITATIONS.md), and [hackathon plan](docs/HACKATHON_PLAN.md).

## Why this can win

Most AI presentation tools optimize for a screenshot that looks acceptable once. Slidewright optimizes for the file people actually have to keep working in. The proof is not a marketing claim: each deck build emits a native `.pptx`, a layout plan, lint results, rendered previews, and an OOXML audit that judges can inspect.

## How Codex contributed

Codex was used to research the current Build Week rules, scaffold the plugin and skill, translate the formatting problem into a deterministic architecture, implement the compiler/linter/renderer/auditor, generate tests, execute the PowerPoint pipeline, and inspect the rendered result. The human-provided product thesis and quality bar were decisive: editable PowerPoint over slide images, symmetric spacing, conventional type sizes, automatic text fit, and Course Explorer-level evidence before completion. The final submission will identify the primary `/feedback` session and document any additional GPT-5.6 sessions used before the release freeze.

Key human decisions still required before submission are the final target-user evidence, the licensed template fixture, the public/private repository choice, the release scope, and the final demo narrative.
